# Product-Event-System-Simulation
Simulation of a Manufacturing Facility for SYSC 4005

To run the code, follow these steps:
  1. Open controller.py and press the run button. Preferably using the PyCharm IDE
  
  2. In the console output you will be asked "Enter the amount of products you want to create: ".
      We recommend you input 15 so that enough interactions are produced to see most of the potential output that is possible.
      Once the input is entered, press the "Enter" key
      
  3. The simulation will now run and will stop once the amount of products you requested have been created.
